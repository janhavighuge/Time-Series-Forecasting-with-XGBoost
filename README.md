# Time-Series-Forecasting-with-XGBoost
Time Series Forecasting using Machine Learning - XGBoost model to predict energy consumption with python 

This project aims to forecast energy use in megawatts using time series analysis and the XGBoost algorithm. The dataset used is the hourly energy consumption data ('PJME_hourly.csv').

## Introduction

Accurately predicting energy consumption is crucial for efficient resource management and decision-making. This project utilizes time series analysis techniques and the powerful XGBoost algorithm to forecast energy use. The goal is to provide reliable predictions that can help energy providers optimize their operations and plan for future demands.

## Methodology

The project follows the following steps:

1. Data Preparation: The dataset is loaded from the 'PJME_hourly.csv' file and preprocessed. The datetime column is set as the index, and time-based features are created.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations are generated to gain insights into the data and understand the relationships between different features and the target variable.
3. Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
4. Model Building: The XGBoost algorithm is used to build a regression model. The selected time-based features are used as input, and the target variable is the energy use in megawatts.
5. Model Evaluation: The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on both the training and testing sets using the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric.
6. Results and Visualization: The model's predictions on the testing set are visualized alongside the actual energy consumption data to assess the forecasting accuracy.
7. Error Analysis: The best and worst predicted days are identified by calculating the mean absolute error for each date.

## Results

The XGBoost model achieves promising results in forecasting energy use. The RMSE score on the test set is calculated to assess the model's performance. Additionally, the best and worst predicted days are identified based on the mean absolute error.

## Next Steps

To further improve the forecasting accuracy and extend the capabilities of this project, the following steps can be considered:

- Implement more robust cross-validation techniques to ensure reliable model evaluation.
- Explore the inclusion of additional features such as weather forecasts, holidays, or special events that may impact energy consumption.
- Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance.
- Consider alternative algorithms or ensemble methods to compare and enhance the predictive capabilities.
